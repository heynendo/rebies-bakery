                <p>Running a small baked goods business has allowed me to turn my love for baking into something people truly enjoy. Every day is a mix of creativity and hard work as I craft delicious treats that bring a smile to my customers. Though the hours can be long, the satisfaction of seeing others appreciate my work makes it all worthwhile.</p>
